# StackUp Platform - Complete System Documentation

## üéØ System Overview

Your StackUp platform is a decentralized freelance/project management system with built-in escrow and participation management. Here's how each component works:

## üìã 1. Bounty System (`stackup-bounty-escrow.clar`)

### How it Works:
1. **Project Owner Creates Bounty**
   - Calls `create-bounty(title, description, category, amount, deadline)`
   - Funds (STX) are **immediately locked** in the contract escrow
   - Bounty gets unique ID and status "open"

2. **Worker Selection Process**
   - Workers apply through UI (handled by participation manager)
   - Owner reviews applications and selects winner
   - Owner calls `select-winner(bounty-id, winner-address)`

3. **Automatic Payment**
   - Funds **automatically transfer** from escrow to winner
   - Bounty status changes to "completed"
   - No manual payment needed - it's instant!

### Key Functions:
- `create-bounty()` - Creates bounty and locks funds
- `select-winner()` - Transfers funds to winner automatically
- `cancel-bounty()` - Refunds owner if no winner selected
- `get-bounty-full-details()` - Complete bounty + escrow info

## üèóÔ∏è 2. Project System (`stackup-project-escrow.clar`)

### How it Works:
1. **Project Creation**
   - Owner calls `create-project(title, description, category, milestones[], deadline)`
   - Milestones define payment amounts for each phase
   - **No funds locked yet** - just project structure created

2. **Developer Selection & Fund Locking**
   - Owner reviews applications and selects developer
   - Owner calls `select-developer(project-id, developer-address)`
   - **Total project amount locked** in escrow at this point

3. **Milestone-Based Payments**
   - Developer completes milestone work
   - Owner calls `approve-milestone(project-id, milestone-index)`
   - **Payment for that milestone released immediately** to developer
   - Process repeats for each milestone

### Key Functions:
- `create-project()` - Creates project structure
- `select-developer()` - Locks total funds and assigns developer
- `approve-milestone()` - Releases payment for completed milestone
- `get-project-progress()` - Shows completion percentage

## üí∞ 3. Grant System (`stackup-grant-escrow.clar`)

### How it Works:
1. **Grant Creation**
   - Owner calls `create-grant(title, description, category, total-amount, deadline)`
   - **Full amount locked immediately** in escrow
   - System calculates 50% upfront and 50% final amounts

2. **Recipient Selection & Upfront Payment**
   - Owner selects recipient from applications
   - Owner calls `select-recipient(grant-id, recipient-address)`
   - **50% automatically paid** to recipient immediately

3. **Completion Payment**
   - Recipient completes grant work
   - Owner calls `approve-completion(grant-id)`
   - **Remaining 50% released** to recipient

### Key Functions:
- `create-grant()` - Creates grant and locks full amount
- `select-recipient()` - Pays 50% upfront automatically
- `approve-completion()` - Pays remaining 50%
- `get-grant-payment-status()` - Shows payment progress

## üé´ 4. Participation System (`stackup-participation-manager.clar`)

### How it Works:
1. **Free Applications**
   - Each user gets **4 free applications per month**
   - Calls `apply-for-opportunity(type, opportunity-id)`
   - Monthly counter resets automatically

2. **Paid Applications**
   - After 4 free uses, user must pay **1 STX per application**
   - Calls `pay-for-application(type, opportunity-id)`
   - Payment goes directly to **platform owner** (you!)

3. **Revenue Tracking**
   - System tracks total applications, paid applications, and revenue
   - Admin functions for configuration and user management

### Key Functions:
- `apply-for-opportunity()` - Free application (up to 4/month)
- `pay-for-application()` - Paid application (1 STX to platform owner)
- `get-application-status()` - Check user's monthly usage
- `get-platform-stats()` - Platform revenue and usage stats

## üîó How Everything Connects

### User Journey:
1. **User applies** for bounty/project/grant via participation manager
2. **Owner reviews** applications and selects winner/developer/recipient
3. **Funds automatically transfer** based on the system type:
   - **Bounty**: Full amount to winner immediately
   - **Project**: Milestone-by-milestone payments
   - **Grant**: 50% upfront, 50% on completion

### Platform Revenue:
- Users pay **1 STX** for each application beyond their 4 free monthly applications
- All payments go directly to **platform owner address**
