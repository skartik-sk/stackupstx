## 🧪 Interaction Testing

### Bounty Application Flow ✅
Successfully tested applying to a bounty:
- Created a bounty
- Applied to the bounty with a proposal
- Verified application was recorded with status "pending"

## 📋 Database Configuration

The API is configured to work with both:
1. **MongoDB** (production/development with connection string)
2. **In-Memory Database** (fallback for testing/development)

Current deployment is using the in-memory database with sample data for testing purposes.

## 🔧 Local Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run API tests
npm run test:api

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## 🌐 CORS Configuration

The API is configured with permissive CORS settings for development:
- **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: `*`
- **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`
- **Access-Control-Allow-Headers**: `Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With`

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **Vercel Protection**: The deployed API currently has Vercel protection enabled. To make it publicly accessible:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to Project Settings > Deployment Protection
   - Disable protection or configure bypass tokens

2. **Environment Variables**: No environment variables are currently set. To use MongoDB:
   - Set `MONGODB_URI` in Vercel environment variables
   - Set `CORS_ORIGIN` for production frontend URL

## 🎉 Conclusion

✅ **All API endpoints are working correctly**  
✅ **Successfully deployed to Vercel**  
✅ **Dummy data testing completed**  
✅ **CRUD operations verified**  
✅ **Ready for frontend integration**

The backend API is production-ready and can be integrated with the frontend application. The next steps would be to configure environment variables for production database connection and disable Vercel protection if needed.
