A Pitch for the Next Evolution of Decentralized Work
1. Executive Summary: The Elevator Pitch
Stack Up is a decentralized marketplace for bounties, grants, and projects, built specifically for the Stacks blockchain ecosystem. Our mission is to solve the critical "talent discovery" and "project funding" gap by creating a unified, on-chain platform where builders and creators can connect with opportunities. We are more than a job board; we are a vibrant community hub where builders "stack up" their skills, reputation, and earnings. We leverage a custom suite of Clarity smart contracts and an AI-powered idea engine to create a platform that is secure, transparent, and incredibly effective.
2. The Problem: A Fragmented Ecosystem
The burgeoning Stacks ecosystem, with its $2B+ market cap and a rapidly growing community of developers, is facing a significant challenge: fragmentation.
Scattered Opportunities: Bounties, grants, and project calls are spread across Discord servers, Twitter threads, and fragmented Notion pages. Builders waste valuable time searching for work instead of focusing on building.
Trust and Transparency Gaps: In a decentralized world, trust is everything. Project creators and developers often rely on private agreements and centralized communication, which introduces counterparty risk and a lack of transparency.
Inefficient Funding: Traditional grant applications and project payments are slow, manual, and often lack a transparent, on-chain execution layer.
The "Hacker House" Problem: While hackathons and in-person events are great, there's no persistent, long-term digital home for this kind of collaborative, project-based work.
3. The Solution: A Unified On-Chain Marketplace
Stack Up provides a singular, elegant solution to this problem by creating a decentralized and transparent marketplace. Our platform is a dedicated hub where all opportunities are consolidated and made discoverable.
For Project Creators (Grantors, Bounty Owners):
Effortlessly post bounties, projects, and grants with clear milestone-based payment schedules.
Funds are held in a secure, audited Clarity smart contract escrow. Funds are only released when milestones are explicitly approved on-chain.
Access to a curated, verified pool of talent with transparent on-chain history and reputation.
For Builders (Developers):
A single destination to find all bounties, grants, and projects in the Stacks ecosystem.
Build a verifiable, on-chain resume and reputation score ("Stacker Score") by completing projects.
Participate in a fair system with guaranteed, transparent payments.
The AI Engine: Our AI analyzes user-submitted ideas, checks for similar concepts, and provides a difficulty ranking. This ensures the ideas page is a source of fresh, unique inspiration, preventing duplicate work and helping builders identify projects that match their skill level.
4. Key Features & Functionality
The platform is designed with a multi-role architecture, ensuring a tailored experience for every user.
A. The Creator's Command Center
Project Creation Forms:
A seamless, multi-step form to create new bounties, grants, or projects.
Bounty Form: Simple, one-time payment.
Grant/Project Form: Milestone-based payments with dynamic fields to define each milestone, its description, and its payment percentage.
Project Management Dashboard:
Live Metrics: A summary of pending applications, total value in escrow, and project status at a glance.
Winner Selection Interface: A clean UI to review applicants. The creator can see their profiles, linked social accounts (GitHub, Twitter), and a button to view their submission. The "Select Winner" button triggers an on-chain transaction to transfer the funds from escrow.
Milestone Approval System: For projects with multiple milestones, a simple interface to approve each one individually. This triggers the partial payment to the developer, all on-chain.
B. The Stacker's Launchpad
Personal Profile:
A verifiable, on-chain identity linked to a Stacks wallet, GitHub, and Twitter.
Stacker Score: A reputation score that grows with each completed project, acting as a trust metric for future opportunities.
Application Tracker: A simple, elegant list of all applications submitted, with real-time status updates (Pending, In Progress, Awarded, Not Selected).
Application Limit:
Each user gets 3-4 free applications per month. This encourages quality over quantity and prevents spam.
After the limit is reached, a small, optional fee (in STX) is required for additional applications, creating a sustainable revenue stream.
C. The Admin's Oversight
Admin Sentinel Dashboard:
Real-time analytics on platform growth: total users, projects created, and total value locked (TVL) in escrow.
A feed of newly submitted projects and ideas for moderation. Admins can approve or reject content to maintain quality.
User management tools to monitor activity and ensure a healthy community.
5. Technology Stack
Our platform is a full-stack, decentralized application built with modern, secure technologies.
Front-End: We are building a modern, responsive web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
React/Next.js: For a high-performance, single-page application and server-side rendering.
UI/UX: A minimalist, sophisticated design with a cream and black color scheme, highlighted by the vibrant orange (#fc6431). The typography will match the clean aesthetic of the official Stacks website, ensuring a cohesive brand experience.
Back-End:
Node.js/Express.js: A robust and scalable server for handling API requests.
MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database to store off-chain data like user profiles, project descriptions, and application history.
Blockchain & Smart Contracts:
Clarity Language: The core business logic is written in Clarity, the security-first smart contract language of Stacks.
Three Escrow Contracts:
bounty-escrow.clar: A simple, one-time payment escrow.
project-milestone-escrow.clar: A more complex, milestone-based escrow.
grant-escrow.clar: A flexible grant approval system.
Stacks.js: The primary JavaScript library for wallet connections, transaction signing, and interacting with the blockchain.
Hiro Stacks API: For fast and efficient querying of on-chain data without running a full node.
AI Integration: A Python-based microservice using libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze ideas and determine difficulty and uniqueness.
6. Monetization & Business Model
Our model is designed for sustainable growth, prioritizing community value over short-term profit.
Tiered Application Model: Our primary revenue stream comes from users paying a small fee (in STX) to submit applications after they've used their 3-4 free monthly applications. This ensures that serious developers who are actively seeking work are the ones who contribute.
Transaction Fees: A small percentage fee on successful bounty and grant payments could be implemented in the future.
Sponsorships: Corporations, DAOs, and protocols building on Stacks can pay to have their bounties featured on the home page, giving them prime visibility to the builder community.
7. Roadmap: From Vision to Impact
Our development plan is broken down into a series of strategic phases, each building on the last to create a powerful network effect.
