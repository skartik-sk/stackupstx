# StackUp Platform - Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment!

Your StackUp platform is now fully configured and ready for Vercel deployment. All dependency conflicts have been resolved and the build is working perfectly.

### ✅ What's Fixed

1. **React Version Conflict**: Downgraded React from v19 to v18.2.0 to match Next.js 14.2.25 requirements
2. **Peer Dependencies**: Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to handle remaining conflicts
3. **Build Configuration**: Updated `vercel.json` with proper install and build commands
4. **No Backend Dependencies**: Platform now works completely standalone with mock data
5. **All TypeScript Errors**: Resolved all compilation errors

### 🛠 Deployment Steps

#### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix React dependencies for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

3. **Environment Variables** (Optional):
   The platform works without these, but you can set them for real blockchain integration:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKS_NETWORK=testnet
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKS_API_URL=https://api.testnet.hiro.so
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BOUNTY_CONTRACT=ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.bounty-escrow
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MILESTONE_CONTRACT=ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.milestone-escrow
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTICIPATE_CONTRACT=ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.participate-stake
   ```

4. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app

#### Option 2: Manual Build Test

```bash
# Test the build locally
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
npm run start
```
